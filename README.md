## Possible Improvisations
1. **Authentication** : One of the most tedious jobs (idk why), I wasnt able to obtain the access token directly using MSAL. Given the time constraint of the hackathon, wasnt able to "optimize" it.
2. **Reinforcement Learning**: ML model should learn from the misclassifications, via the user interface in outlook
